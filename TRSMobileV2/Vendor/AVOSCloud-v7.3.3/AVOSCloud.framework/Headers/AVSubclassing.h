 If a subclass of AVObject conforms to AVSubclassing and calls registerSubclass, LeanCloud will be able to use that class as the native class for a LeanCloud object.

 Classes conforming to this protocol should subclass AVObject and include AVObject+Subclass.h in their implementation file. This ensures the methods in the Subclass category of AVObject are exposed in its subclasses only.
